# Abaddon Client
The forefront of my modpacks, this modpack is the foundation for all other ones I intend to make. Although this is not the largest foundation for them, that would belong to [Abaddon-Vanilla](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-vanilla) which is of course, based off of this modpack.
You can download [Abaddon Client](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-client) on CurseForge, others are not allowed to distribute, modify or release files from the modpack in any manner, unto others.
# Changelogs
I like my [changelogs](https://github.com/Apollonu/Abaddon-Client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to be extensive, if there are any errors for some reason, make a Pull request and I will fix it. Do not abuse the Pull request for any reason whatsoever.
